print("Hello, World!")

# for i in range (100):
    # print("Hello, World! " + str(i))

################# Data Types ###################
# integer (int) = 1
# string (str) = "Hello World"
# float  (float) = number with decimal, 1.54
# boolean (bool) = True
# boolean (bool) = False
# nonetype - absence of a value

# Everything in Python is a Object. Objects are put into Categories, the data types

# Python has three types of Operators:
#  - Arithmetic Operators
#  - Comparison Operators
#  - Logical Operators


# Arithmetic Opeartors
# Expression: A line of code that Python reduces to a single value. 
# print ( 4 / 2 ) 
# Operators: 
# - Exponent **
# - Modulo: %
# - Integer division: //
# - Division: /
# - Multiplication: *
# - Addition: + 
# - Subtraction: - 

# Comparison Operators
# Test six conditions
# > Greater Than
# < Less Than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# <= Less than or equal to
# == Equal
# != Not Equal

# Logical Operators
# - evaluate to True or False
# - and
# - or
# - not

# Statements
# - describes various parts of the Pyhton language. Like a command or calculation
# Condition Statements:
# if this;
#     do("that") 
# otherwise: 
#     do("something else")

# Pseudocode
# if(expression) then:
#     code_area_1
# else:  
#     code_area_2

x = 10
if x == 10:
    print("x is 10.")
else:
    print("x is not 10. x is " + str(x))

x = 19
if x == 10:
    print("x is 10.")
elif x % 2 == 0:
    print("x is even.")
elif x == 19:
    print("x is 19")
else:
    print("x is not 10.")
# you can have multiple "elif" statements but can onle have on "if" and one "else" statment
# you can put multiple coditional statements.
# you can also put an if statement within an if statement. its called "Nesting"

#Simple Statements
# - span over one line
# Compound Statements 
# - span over multiple lines
